        <h2>German Language Civilization</h2>
        <p>The German language, a member of the West Germanic language family, has a fascinating history and is spoken by over 130 million people worldwide.</p>
        <p>German, known as "Deutsch", has its roots in the early Germanic tribes, with the earliest written records dating back to the 8th century. Over time, it has evolved through various stages and has been influenced by other languages, including Latin, French, and English.</p>
        <p>One of the most significant periods in the history of the German language is the Middle High German period (1050-1350), which saw the emergence of a standardized written form and the flourishing of literature, poetry, and religious texts.</p>
        <p>During the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods, German became a language of science, philosophy, and literature, with renowned figures such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Nietzsche contributing greatly to its prestige.</p>
        <p>Today, German is not only the official language of Germany, but also of Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. It is also widely spoken in parts of Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>

        <iframe src="img/books.Germany.mp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>German grammar follows a similar structure to other Germanic languages, with nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions forming the core components of sentences. It also features grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive) that indicate the role of nouns within sentences.</p>
        <p>Mastering German grammar requires practice and patience, but with dedication, it becomes easier over time. There are many online resources and language courses available to help you improve your grammar skills.    </p>
